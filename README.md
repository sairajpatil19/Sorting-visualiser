📊 Sorting Visualizer
This is a web-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and Python (Flask) for the backend. It helps users visually understand how different sorting algorithms work by animating each step.

🚀 Features
Visualizes the sorting process of:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Smooth animations and an aesthetic UI

Responsive, fast, and interactive

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python with Flask

Communication: REST API (/sort)

Styling: Custom CSS + Google Fonts

CORS Enabled: To allow frontend-backend communication

🔁 How It Works
A random array is generated.

User selects a sorting algorithm.

Frontend sends the array and algorithm to the Flask backend.

Backend returns a list of "steps" in sorting.

Frontend animates each step as vertical bars.
